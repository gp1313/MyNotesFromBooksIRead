# The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck

### Gyaan on approach to living a good life



## Chapter One : Don't Try

- Charlie Bukowski, a failure and also a poet. 
- His work got rejected from publisher pushing him to an alcoholic-fueled depression.
- At the age of 50, a small publisher took a chance upon him and promised to publish his work but for very less money. His current day job was letter filler. He decided to take up the opportuinity and said he would rather die of starvation then stay in his current situation and go crazy.
- He wrote his first novel in 3 weeks that went on to be huge success. He wrote 5 more and hundreds of poems also. From outside his story looks to be very inspirational.
- Bukowski's tomb has text that reads "Don't Try". He was a loser and he very well knew it and wrote about it. In fact his ability to be completely, unflintchingly honest with himself showed that honesty in his work which made his work so popular.
- His real story of success was his his comfort with himself as a failure.
- His success as writer did not change him as a person. He was still a alcoholic abusive womanizer. Self-improvement and success often occure together but they are not same.
- Our current culture has problem of unrealistic positivity expectation. We  want to find out what all we lack and make it go away. Everything that we lack, which makes us focus on everything we lack. 
- Instead of chasing a mirage of happiness and satisfaction by been attached to superficial and fake things we should focus on less stuff, the stuff that is true, immediate and important.
